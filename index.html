                </p>

                <h3 class="dc-subhead">Premise</h3>
                <p>The Justice League is formed to combat threats that are too significant for any single hero to handle
                    alone. Operating from various bases, like the Hall of Justice or the Watchtower satellite, they take
                    on intergalactic threats, powerful supervillains, and catastrophic events.</p>
                <h3 class="dc-subhead">Key Storylines</h3>
                <p>Through the years, the Justice League has faced various challenges, from battling the cosmic tyrant
                    Darkseid and his quest to subdue the Earth, to the "Injustice League" and other villainous
                    counterparts, and events that shake the very fabric of reality like "Crisis on Infinite Earths."</p>
                <h3 class="dc-subhead">Impact</h3>
                <p>The Justice League has become a cornerstone of the DC Universe and has been adapted into various
                    forms of media, including animated series, movies, and video games. The team symbolizes unity, hope,
                    and the combined strength of diverse individuals coming together for a common cause.</p>

                <h3 class="dc-subhead">Superman</h3>
                <p>Superman, also known as the Man of Steel, is a fictional superhero who appears in comic books
                    published
                    by DC Comics. He was created by writer Jerry Siegel and artist Joe Shuster in 1938. Born as Kal-El
                    on
                    the dying planet Krypton, he is sent to Earth by his parents in a small spaceship. Discovered and
                    adopted by the Kents in Smallville, Kansas, he is raised as Clark Kent. As he grows, he discovers
                    his
                    superhuman abilities, including super-strength, flight, heat vision, and x-ray vision, among others.
                    Guided by the strong moral compass instilled by his adoptive parents, he moves to the city of
                    Metropolis
                    and takes a job as a reporter at the Daily Planet. Using his powers, he defends humanity from
                    various
                    threats, including his arch-nemesis, Lex Luthor. Superman's iconic emblem is a red "S" shield, and
                    he
                    often wears a blue costume with a red cape. Over the years, he has become one of the most
                    recognizable
                    and enduring characters in popular culture, symbolizing hope, justice, and the better aspects of
                    humanity.</p>

                <h3 class="dc-subhead">Batman</h3>
                <p>Batman, also known as the Dark Knight, is a fictional superhero appearing in comic books published by
                    DC Comics. Created by artist Bob Kane and writer Bill Finger, the character first appeared in 1939.
                    Unlike many superheroes, Batman does not possess any superhuman powers; instead, he relies on his
                    intellect, detective skills, technology, wealth, and physical prowess to combat crime.

                    Born as Bruce Wayne, he witnesses the murder of his parents, Thomas and Martha Wayne, in a mugging
                    gone wrong in Gotham City when he was a child. This traumatic event drives him to train rigorously
                    and dedicate his life to fighting crime. As an adult, Bruce becomes a billionaire industrialist and
                    philanthropist, but by night he assumes the identity of Batman, operating out of the Batcave and
                    using a variety of gadgets, vehicles like the Batmobile, and his butler Alfred Pennyworth's
                    assistance.

                    Gotham City is rife with crime and corruption, and Batman faces a rogue's gallery of villains,
                    including the Joker, Catwoman, the Penguin, and the Riddler, among others. While he is a vigilante,
                    often operating outside of the law, Batman is driven by a strict moral code and does not kill. The
                    character has become an icon of popular culture, representing justice, perseverance, and the
                    capacity of humanity to confront its darkest aspects.</p>

                    and emotion. This was followed by a more comedic spinoff, "Teen Titans Go!" in 2013, which focuses
                    on the humorous side of the characters. Additionally, a live-action series titled "Titans" premiered
                    in 2018, offering a darker take on the team's stories.</p>
